## Kaplan-Miere estimator of the entire dataset

Death Time
```{r}
KM <- survfit(Surv(dtime, death) ~ 1, data = rotterdam)
plot(KM, conf.int = TRUE, col = "blue", xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
```

```{r}
mean(rotterdam$dtime)
median(rotterdam$dtime)
```

The overall mean survival time till death for breast cancer is 2605 days, which is approximately 7 years. The overall median survival time till death for breast cancer is 2638 days, which is also approximately 7 years.

Recurrence Time
```{r}
KM <- survfit(Surv(rtime, recur) ~ 1, data = rotterdam)
plot(KM, conf.int = TRUE, col = "blue", xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
```

```{r}
mean(rotterdam$rtime)
median(rotterdam$rtime)
```

The overall mean survival time till recurrence for breast cancer is 2097 days, which is approximately 6 years. The overall median survival time till recurrence for breast cancer is 1940 days, which is also approximately 5 years.

```{r}
KM <- survfit(Surv(drecurtime, death) ~ 1, data = rotterdam_recur)
plot(KM, conf.int = TRUE, col = "blue", xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
```

```{r}
mean(rotterdam_recur$drecurtime)
median(rotterdam_recur$drecurtime)
```

The overall mean survival time after rucurrence till death for breast cancer is 834 days, which is approximately a little more than 2 years. The overall median survival time after rucurrence till death for breast cancer is 625 days, which is approximately less than 2 years.

Since a Kaplan-Miere estimator is unbiased, we could view the median as being very close to the true value of survival time. 

## Kaplan-Miere estimator on different variables in `rotterdam`

There are 16 variables in the `rotterdam` dataset. Of course we could have fit each variable with a KM estimator, but it would be meaningless to do them all. We will stick to the Diagnostics and Treatment we mentioned in Chapter 2 and fit `size`, `Nodes_level`(we are not using nodes because a Kaplan-Miere estimator does not work well with quantitative variables), and `Treatment` each with KM estimators with respect to `dtime`, `rtime`, and `drecurtime` to grasp the survival time within each categories of the variables.

### `size` vs. Survival Times

`size` vs. `dtime`
```{r}
KM_None_Death <- survfit(Surv(dtime, death) ~ size, data = rotterdam)
plot(KM_None_Death, conf.type = "plain", col = c("black","red","blue"), xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
legend(6000, 1, legend=c("<=20", "20-50", ">50"),
       col=c("black", "red", "blue"), lty=1, cex=0.8,
       title="Tumor Size", text.font=6)
```

`size` vs. `rtime`
```{r}
KM_None_Recur <- survfit(Surv(rtime, recur) ~ size, data = rotterdam)
plot(KM_None_Recur, conf.type = "plain", col = c("black","red","blue"), xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
legend(6000, 1, legend=c("<=20", "20-50", ">50"),
       col=c("black", "red", "blue"), lty=1, cex=0.8,
       title="Tumor Size", text.font=6)
```

In general, patients with smaller tumor at diagnosis enjoys longer survival for both death and recurrence.

```{r}
KM_None_drecur <- survfit(Surv(drecurtime, death) ~ size, data = rotterdam_recur)
plot(KM_None_drecur, conf.type = "plain", col = c("black","red","blue"), xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
legend(4500, 1, legend=c("<=20", "20-50", ">50"),
       col=c("black", "red", "blue"), lty=1, cex=0.8,
       title="Tumor Size", text.font=6)
```

The trend is still the same as patients with smaller tumor size enjoy longer survival of death after recurrence, but the survival time now decreases much faster for all groups.

### `Nodes_level` vs. Survival Times

`Nodes_level` vs. `dtime`
```{r}
KM_None_Death <- survfit(Surv(dtime, death) ~ Nodes_level, data = rotterdam)
plot(KM_None_Death, conf.type = "plain", col = c("black","red","blue","orange"), xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
legend(6000, 1, legend=c("N0", "N1","N2", "N3"),
       col=c("black", "red", "blue", "orange"), lty=1, cex=0.8,
       title="Nodes_level", text.font=6)
```

`Nodes_level` vs. `rtime`
```{r}
KM_None_Recur <- survfit(Surv(rtime, recur) ~ Nodes_level, data = rotterdam)
plot(KM_None_Recur, conf.type = "plain", col = c("black","red","blue","orange"), xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
legend(6000, 1, legend=c("N0", "N1","N2", "N3"),
       col=c("black", "red", "blue", "orange"), lty=1, cex=0.8,
       title="Nodes_level", text.font=6)
```

In general, patients with less nodes tested positive will enjoy longer survival for both death and recurrence.

`Nodes_level` vs. `drecurtime`
```{r}
KM_None_drecur <- survfit(Surv(drecurtime, death) ~ Nodes_level, data = rotterdam_recur)
plot(KM_None_drecur, conf.type = "plain", col = c("black","red","blue","orange"), xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
legend(4500, 1, legend=c("N0", "N1","N2", "N3"),
       col=c("black", "red", "blue", "orange"), lty=1, cex=0.8,
       title="Nodes_level", text.font=6)
```

The trend is still the same as patients with fewer nodes tested positive enjoy longer survival of death after recurrence, but the survival time now decreases much faster for all groups, and the difference is small in groups `N1`, `N2` and `N3`.

### `Treatment` vs. Survival Times

`Treatment` vs. `dtime`
```{r warning=FALSE}
KM_Treatment_Death <- survfit(Surv(dtime, death) ~ Treatment, data = rotterdam)
plot(KM_Treatment_Death, conf.int = FALSE, col = c("black", "red", "blue", "orange"), xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
legend(1, 0.4, legend=c("Both", "Chemo","Hormon", "NaN/Other Treatment"),
       col=c("black", "red", "blue", "orange"), lty=1, cex=0.8,
       title="Treatment Group", text.font=6)
```

`Treatment` vs. `rtime`
```{r}
KM_Treatment_Recur <- survfit(Surv(rtime, recur) ~ Treatment, data = rotterdam)
plot(KM_Treatment_Recur, conf.int = FALSE, col = c("black", "red", "blue", "orange"), xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
legend(1, 0.4, legend=c("Both", "Chemo","Hormon", "NaN/Other Treatment"),
       col=c("black", "red", "blue", "orange"), lty=1, cex=0.8,
       title="Treatment Group", text.font=6)
```

As we have discussed in Chapter 2, we know that generally chemotherapy is used on patients with age lower than 50 years old and hormontherapy is used on patients with age higher than 50 years old. Based on the difference of treatment, we could see that chemotherapy has a better effect than hormontherapy with respect to death time and a smaller yet still better effect regarding the recurrence time.

`Treatment` vs. `drecurtime`
```{r}
KM_Treatment_drecur <- survfit(Surv(drecurtime, death) ~ Treatment, data = rotterdam_recur)
plot(KM_Treatment_drecur, conf.int = FALSE, col = c("black", "red", "blue", "orange"), xlab="Days", ylab="Survival")
legend(3700, 1, legend=c("Both", "Chemo","Hormon", "NaN/Other Treatment"),
       col=c("black", "red", "blue", "orange"), lty=1, cex=0.8,
       title="Treatment Group", text.font=6)
```

However, sadly enough, from the above plot we could see that no matter what treatment a patient use, it does not make a difference for the death survival time after cancer cells have recurred. This matches our conclusion from the visualization in Chapter 2.

## Parametric Models

Another point that we are going to explore is if we would be able to fit our data to a parametric model. This matters since if we could fit any parametric model, then we should have a model good enough to generate predictions of breast cancer patients' survival and would have nice and interpretable coefficients to work with.

To do so, we will begin by checking if any of Exponential, Weibull, or Log-normal distribution would be adequate parametric assumption to cast on our data. We will verify the adequacy by checking the Cox-Snell residual plot. We will be fitting models using variables: `Treatment`, `size`, `nodes`, `age`(We have shown in Chapter 2 that age is a confounder for categories in Treatment).

### User-defined Cox-Snell function

```{r}
# The Cox-Snell function takes as inputs
# 1. A vector of Cox-Snell residuals created by the user based on the model being evaluated,
# 2. A status vector
# 3. Optional x- and y- limits for the resulting plot

CoxSnell = function(cs,status,xlim=NULL,ylim=NULL)
{
kmcs = survfit(Surv(jitter(cs,amount=(max(cs)-min(cs))/1000),status) ~ 1)$surv

plot(log(-log(kmcs)) ~ sort(log(cs)) ,
      xlab="log(Cox-Snell)", ylab="log(-log(S(Cox-Snell)))", xlim=xlim, ylim=ylim )

abline(0,1,col='red')
}
```

### Exponential models

We will begin by verifying the adequacy of Exponential model.

```{r}
Dexp <- survreg(Surv(dtime, death) ~ Treatment + size + nodes + age, dist='exponential', data=rotterdam)
Dexp
```

![](Cox-Snell/DexpDeath.png)

```{r}
Dexp <- survreg(Surv(rtime, recur) ~ Treatment + size + nodes + age, dist='exponential', data=rotterdam)
Dexp
```

![](Cox-Snell/DexpRecur.png)

The Exponential does not seem adequate in this case.

### Weibull models

Next we will examine the adequacy of Weibull model.

```{r}
Dweibull <- survreg(Surv(dtime, death) ~ Treatment + size + nodes + age, dist='weibull', data=rotterdam)
Dweibull
```

![](Cox-Snell/DweibullDeath.png)

```{r}
Dweibull <- survreg(Surv(rtime, recur) ~ Treatment + size + nodes + age, dist='weibull', data=rotterdam)
Dweibull
```

![](Cox-Snell/DweibullRecur.png)

The Weibull model is still not adequate.

### Log-normal models

Finally, we will examine the adequacy of Log-normal model.

```{r}
Dlnorm <- survreg(Surv(dtime, death) ~ Treatment + size + nodes + age , dist='lognormal', data=rotterdam)
Dlnorm
CS_LnormD <- -log(1 - plnorm(rotterdam$dtime, 9.709442268-0.431016329*(rotterdam$Treatment=="Chemo")
                                                  -0.346351742*(rotterdam$Treatment=="Hormon")  
                                                  -0.423626557*(rotterdam$Treatment=="NaN/Other Treatment")
                                                  -0.372703559*(rotterdam$size=="20-50")
                                                  -0.654189313*(rotterdam$size==">50")
                                                  -0.079103425*rotterdam$nodes 
                                                  -0.009903862*rotterdam$age, 
                                       1.077329))
# Make appropriate graph using CoxSnell function
CoxSnell(CS_LnormD, rotterdam$death)
```

```{r}
Rlnorm <- survreg(Surv(rtime, recur) ~ Treatment + size + nodes + age, dist='lognormal', data=rotterdam)
Rlnorm
CS_LnormR <- -log(1 - plnorm(rotterdam$rtime, 8.514204484-0.382172447*(rotterdam$Treatment=="Chemo")
                                                  -0.479063703*(rotterdam$Treatment=="Hormon")   
                                                  -0.605193863*(rotterdam$Treatment=="NaN/Other Treatment")
                                                  -0.458345796*(rotterdam$size=="20-50")
                                                  -0.738657689*(rotterdam$size==">50")
                                                  -0.107708963*rotterdam$nodes 
                                                  +0.009059467*rotterdam$age, 
                                       1.340545))

# Make appropriate graph using CoxSnell function
CoxSnell(CS_LnormR, rotterdam$recur)
```

We could see that the Log-normal parametric model is an adequate model for both the `dtime` and `rtime` vs. `Treatment` + `size` + `nodes` + `age`.

As to why the Log-normal model would be suitable for the data, we are not sure. One thing to consider is that the non-monotonic implication of the data casted by the log-normal model.

### Positive coefficient of `age`

In the `rtime ~ Treatment + size + nodes + age` models, it is surprised to see that the coefficient of `age` is positive, though the value is small. One possible explanation could be the idea of "competing events" and "competing risk".

In this scenario, having recurred breast cancer and being dead could be somewhat "competing events". Though they are not completely "cannot happen on one person at the same time", it is still reasonable to think that for older patients, it is more likely to die from breast cancer or other complications than being cancer-free for years and then having breast cancer recurred; whereas for younger people, the risk of having recurrent breast cancer could be higher than being dead from the first breast cancer.

```{r}
rotterdam_new <- rotterdam %>% 
  mutate(state = ifelse(death == 1 & recur == 0, "death",
                 ifelse(death == 0 & recur == 1, "recur", 
                 ifelse(death == 1 & recur == 1, "both", "neither"))))

ggplot(rotterdam_new, aes(x=age, color=state, fill=state)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.3)
```

The plot above also helps verifying the idea. We can find that the group who has been dead during the study but has never had breast cancer recurred (the green one) tends to be older than others.

The positive coefficient of `age` in the log-normal model may seem indicating a protective effect of being old against having breast cancer recurred, but this should not be the true case. It is very likely that this is caused by the competing risk between being dead and having breast cancer recurred for people in different age group. The elderly patients are less likely to suffer from recurrent breast cancer because they are more likely to die from breast cancer or other complications during the treatment after the first diagnosis.

## Cox-PH model:

Another very important part of a survival analysis is building and interpreting the coxph model. With this model, once we have proof of the validation of the PH assumption of the model, we could have nice coefficients to interpret as the logarithm of HR(hazard ratio) among different groups. We will be following the way that we built our parametric models, by using Survival times vs. `age` + `size` + `nodes` + `Treatment`.

### `dtime` coxph model

```{r}
m_death_withage = coxph(Surv(dtime, death) ~ Treatment + size + nodes + age, data=rotterdam)
m_death_withage
```

First we should check if the PH assumption holds. We will be using a formal test.

```{r}
cox.zph(m_death_withage)
```

One of the variable, `age`, has p-value smaller than 0.05, which indicates the violation of the PH assumption. So we can not intepret the coefficients right away.

One way we came up to solve this problem is to put stratification on `age` by putting a `strata()` on `age` when fitting the model. What this does is to recognize the correlation between `age` and the `dtime`, but not actually including it in our model results. 

```{r}
m_death_strataage = coxph(Surv(dtime, death) ~ Treatment + size + nodes + strata(age), data=rotterdam)
m_death_strataage
cox.zph(m_death_strataage)
```

Now we can see that all the variables' p-value are greater than 0.05 which indicates the PH assumption holds in our model. Now we can finally intepret the coefficients. 

For treatments, we can see that Chemotherapy, Hormontherapy and Other Treatment all have higher risks than patients receiving both therapies. However, note that all three p-values are greater than 0.05, which means that we do not have significant evidence for such relationships. We think that this is because there are too few data point receiving both therapies.

Now let's look at tumor size. It is clear that patients with larger tumor size enjoy higher risks, and as the size grows, the risk is also increasing. such relationship is significant as we can see from the p-values since they are all less than 0.05.

For lymph nodes tested positive, we could see that for 1 unit increase in the number of nodes, the risk will increase by a multiplicative of 1.08. This relationship is also significant as the p-value is smaller than 0.05.

```{r}
m_recur = coxph(Surv(rtime, recur) ~ Treatment + size + nodes + age, data=rotterdam)
m_recur
cox.zph(m_recur)
```

```{r}
m_recur = coxph(Surv(rtime, recur) ~ strata(Treatment) + size + nodes + age, data=rotterdam)
m_recur
cox.zph(m_recur)
```
