[["index.html", "Rotterdam Chapter1 Motivation 1.1 Some Background Information", " Rotterdam JACK TAN, YIMING MIAO 2021-03-09 Chapter1 Motivation According to World Health Organization\\(*\\), Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. And amongst all cancer types, breast cancer(along with lung cancer) has the top cases of death: 2.09 million cases in 2018. According to the CDC\\(*\\), Breast cancer is also the second most common cancer among women in the United States, comprising 22.9% of invasive cancers in women and 16% of all female cancers. However, because of the cancer's characteristics, breast cancer patients have relatively high 5-year survival rate of 85% compared to other more lethal cancers according to research conducted in the UK\\(*\\). We think it is worthwhile to look at the relationship between survival/recurrence time and some diagnostic criterion. We are also going to explore the effect of different treatments on survival/recurrence. Finally we will look at all the factors together. 1.1 Some Background Information For doctors to be able to assess the severity and different types of breast cancer, researchers have come up with a diagnosing system called the TNM\\(*\\) Staging system that is widely used in the diagnostics of breast cancer: Tumor(T): How large is the primary tumor in the breast? Node (N): Has the tumor spread to the lymph nodes? If so, where, what size, and how many? Metastasis (M): Has the cancer spread to other parts of the body? Generally, the results from the above three features are combined to form a diagnosis of a total of 5 stages of breast cancer: stage 0 (zero), which is non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and stages I through IV (1 through 4), which are used for invasive breast cancer. We will be using data related to this system, especially Tumor and Node(since metastasis is often not recorded in datasets), to conduct our exploration. "],["data-exploration.html", "Chapter2 Data Exploration 2.1 Loading Data 2.2 Data Wrangling 2.3 Data visualizations and exploration", " Chapter2 Data Exploration 2.1 Loading Data data(rotterdam) The data that we are going to use is called rotterdam, and it is a dataset that's pre-recorded in the survival package. According to the documentation of the package, the data are retrieved from the Rotterdam tumor bank, which include various anonymous information about patients with breast cancer. Below is a table of the variables in the dataset: Variable name Description pid patient identifier year year of cancer incidence age age meno menopausal status (0= premenopausal, 1= postmenopausal) size tumor size, a factor with levels &lt;=20, 20-50, &gt;50 grade tumor grade nodes number of positive lymph nodes pgr progesterone receptors (fmol/l) er estrogen receptors (fmol/l) hormon hormonal treatment (0=no, 1=yes) chemo chemotherapy rtime days to recurrence or last follow-up recur 0= no recurrence, 1= recurrence dtime days to death or last follow-up death 0= alive, 1= dead From the description above, we see that there are size which stands for the size of the tumor, nodes which stands for how many lymph nodes are test cancer positive, so we have 2 criterions out of the three suggested in the background info. 2.2 Data Wrangling rotterdam %&gt;% group_by(size) %&gt;% summarise(number = n(), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## size number ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 &lt;=20 1387 ## 2 20-50 1291 ## 3 &gt;50 304 The number of lymph nodes tested positive is a important measure in the TNM system. However, right now the nodes variable in our dataset is numeric and makes it hard for us to make visualization. For visualization purpose, we will make a new categorical variable called Nodes_level. For lymph nodes tested positive, the usual medical way of classifying the severity would be:N0 for no positive nodes; N1 for 1-3 positive nodes; N2 for 4-9 positive nodes; and N3 for more than 10 nodes. We will follow this classification method. rotterdam &lt;- rotterdam %&gt;% mutate(Nodes_level = ifelse(nodes == 0, &quot;N0&quot;, ifelse(nodes &gt;= 1 &amp; nodes &lt;= 3, &quot;N1&quot;, ifelse(nodes &gt;= 4 &amp; nodes &lt;= 9, &quot;N2&quot;, ifelse(nodes &gt;= 10, &quot;N3&quot;, NaN))))) rotterdam %&gt;% group_by(Nodes_level) %&gt;% summarise(number = n(), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) ## # A tibble: 4 x 2 ## Nodes_level number ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 N0 1436 ## 2 N1 764 ## 3 N2 515 ## 4 N3 267 Since the grade variable in our dataset is a numeric variable whereas we actually want to treat it as a factor, we do the following: rotterdam &lt;- rotterdam %&gt;% mutate(grade = as.factor(grade)) As we were examining through the data, we found that upon the chemo variable and the hormon variable, there are instances where patients gets both therapy or neither. So in order to explore the relationship between treatment and survival, we introduce a new variable called Treatment, using the chemo and hormon variables. rotterdam &lt;- rotterdam %&gt;% mutate(Treatment = ifelse(chemo == 1 &amp; hormon == 0, &quot;Chemo&quot;, ifelse(chemo == 0 &amp; hormon == 1, &quot;Hormon&quot;, ifelse(chemo == 1 &amp; hormon == 1, &quot;Both&quot;, &quot;NaN/Other Treatment&quot;)))) %&gt;% mutate(Treatment = as.factor(Treatment)) Note that in this manner as we try to 'merge' two binary variables into one variable with four levels, we are assuming interaction between chemo and hormon. rotterdam_recur &lt;- rotterdam %&gt;% filter(recur == 1) %&gt;% mutate(drecurtime = dtime-rtime) nrow(rotterdam_recur) ## [1] 1518 We also thought it would be of interest to invesigate how recurrnce of tumor might affect the survival of the patient. We made a new dataset called rotterdam_recur, which only include patients with recur = 1. Now the dataset contains 1518 data points, a little over the original rotterdam dataset. We will label the time from recurrence to death as drecurtime in the new data frame. 2.3 Data visualizations and exploration 2.3.1 Diagnostics vs. Survival Times It is commonly considered that the earlier the breast cancer is detected and the earlier it is treated, the longer survival a patient might enjoy. Thus we think it is important to first look at the diagnostics before treatment and visualize their relationship with survival times. size vs. dtime ggplot(data = rotterdam, aes(x = size, y = dtime, fill = size)) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) size vs. rtime ggplot(data = rotterdam, aes(x = size, y = rtime, fill = size)) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) size vs. drecurtime ggplot(data = rotterdam_recur, aes(x = size, y = drecurtime, fill = size)) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) As we can see from the three plots above, tumor size could be an important factor that affects patients' survival time and recur time. For size smaller than 20, most of the patients are able to survive or encounter recurrence after roughly 3000 days. But for size 20-50 and &gt;50, it's highly likely for cancer cells to recur in 500 days. However, after cancer cells have recurred, most patients could not survive over 2 years. Nodes_level vs. dtime ggplot(data = rotterdam, aes(x = Nodes_level, y = dtime, fill = Nodes_level)) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) Nodes_level vs. rtime ggplot(data = rotterdam, aes(x = Nodes_level, y = rtime, fill = Nodes_level)) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) Nodes_level vs. drecurtime ggplot(data = rotterdam_recur, aes(x = Nodes_level, y = drecurtime, fill = Nodes_level)) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) Similarly, nodes is also a factor impacting the life of breast cancer patients. In fact, for patients with high Nodes_level, it is typically considered they are either having metastasis of the cancer or already experiencing a regional recurrence of the cancer. Thus, we could see that most patients with N2 or N3 Nodes_level experience recurrence shortly after treatment. However, after tumor has recurred, most patients could not survive over 2 years. 2.3.2 Treatment vs. Survival Times Next we are also going to look at the effect of different types of treatments on the survival times of breast cancer patients. Treatment vs. dtime ggplot(data = rotterdam, aes(x = Treatment, y = dtime, fill = Treatment)) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) Treatment vs. rtime ggplot(data = rotterdam, aes(x = Treatment, y = rtime, fill = Treatment)) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) Treatment vs. drecurtime ggplot(data = rotterdam_recur, aes(x = Treatment, y = drecurtime, fill = Treatment)) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) By examing the three plots above, it seems that Treatment would not affect patients survival time or recurrence that much. We can find that chemo + hormon is likely to be the one with best curative effect, that patients receiving both chemo and hormon therapy tend to have longer survival time and longer time to recurrence. And the effect of hormon therapy itself seems not that satisfying. However, after tumor have recurred, most patients do not live up to 2 years. We also found a bi-model shape in NaN/Other Traetment group in rtime vs. Treatment. This may because the two peaks correponds to no treatment and other treatment separately, but currently we don't have more information investigating the true reason. 2.3.3 age + Treatment vs. Survival Times age + Treatment vs. dtime As we were visualizing for Treatment vs. dtime, we found that Hormontherapy generally has a weaker effect than Chemotherapy, but we think there might be some confounding variables that leads to such conclusion. One that we discovered is age: ggplot(data = rotterdam, aes(x = age, y = dtime, color = Treatment)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) age + Treatment vs. rtime ggplot(data = rotterdam, aes(x = age, y = rtime, color = Treatment)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) It might be different to see from the plots right now, so we decided to make a partial plot of the full plot by filtering the patients who did not take either treatment out. rotterdam_new &lt;-rotterdam %&gt;% filter(Treatment != &quot;NaN/Other Treatment&quot;) %&gt;% filter(Treatment != &quot;Both&quot;) age + Treatment vs. dtime ggplot(data = rotterdam_new, aes(x = age, y = dtime, color = Treatment)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) age + Treatment vs. rtime ggplot(data = rotterdam_new, aes(x = age, y = rtime, color = Treatment)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) From the two plots above we could see that the patients who took either chemo therapy or hormon therapy are clearly clusterd. For the group who only took chemotherapy, most patients' age are located below 50 years old. For the group who only took hormontherapy, most patients' age are located above 50 years old. This is because chemotherapy might have more negative effects for patients at larger age than hormontherapy and thus would effect survival if the wrong therapy is given. Generally, hormontherapy is more friendly to elder people but chemotherapy has better effect. 2.3.4 General X-year Survival Rate A very important criterion in analysis about cancer is the 5-year survival rate. In order to examine that, we introduce a new variable called 5_year_survival, which indicates 1 if a patients survival time is larger than 5 years and 0 vice versa. rotterdam &lt;- rotterdam %&gt;% mutate(dtime_Years = floor(dtime/365)) %&gt;% mutate(`5_year_survival` = ifelse(dtime_Years &gt;= 5, 1, 0)) Now we want to calculate the 5-year survival rate for the population in the dataset. rotterdam %&gt;% group_by(`5_year_survival`) %&gt;% summarise(number = n(), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## `5_year_survival` number ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 898 ## 2 1 2084 2084/(898+2084) ## [1] 0.6988598 And also the important 10-year survival rate. rotterdam &lt;- rotterdam %&gt;% mutate(dtime_Years = floor(dtime/365)) %&gt;% mutate(`10_year_survival` = ifelse(dtime_Years &gt;= 10, 1, 0)) Now we calculate the 10-year survival rate for the population in the dataset. rotterdam %&gt;% group_by(`10_year_survival`) %&gt;% summarise(number = n(), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## `10_year_survival` number ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 2297 ## 2 1 685 685/(685 + 2297) ## [1] 0.2297116 We can find that the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is just fine, and around 70% of patients are able to live more than 5 years. However, the 10-year survival rate is still disappointing given the current medical level, and only around 20% patients could live more than 10 years after diagnosis. rotterdam %&gt;% group_by(grade) %&gt;% summarise(number = n(), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## grade number ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 2 794 ## 2 3 2188 However, we have to notice that in our dataset, most patients are diagnosed with stage III breast cancer and a small portion are diagnosed with stage II breast cancer, which makes their cancer pretty severe already. This would give a pessimistic calculation of 5-year/ 10-year survival rates of breast cancer patients as a whole. In fact, according to webMD.com, the overall 5-year relative survival rate for breast cancer is 90% and the 10-year breast cancer relative survival rate is 84%. Thus the important point is that female with high risk of breast caner(family inheritance, bad life habits, etc.) should have regular physical examination, with proper screening for breast cancer. Even if diagnosed, do not panic and take treatment as soon as possible. In this way, a breast cancer patients might be able to enjoy longer survival. Another important yet sad point is that after cancer has recurred, it does not matter what treatment a patient takes and most people do not live up to 2 years if recurred. Thus patients should be extremely careful not getting cancer recurred.

The overall median survival time after rucurrence till death for breast cancer is 625 days, which is approximately less than 2 years. Since a Kaplan-Miere estimator is unbiased, we could view the median as being very close to the true value of survival time. 3.3 Kaplan-Miere estimator on different variables in rotterdam There are 16 variables in the rotterdam dataset. Of course we could have fit each variable with a KM estimator, but it would be meaningless to do them all. We will stick to the Diagnostics and Treatment we mentioned in Chapter 2 and fit size, Nodes_level(we are not using nodes because a Kaplan-Miere estimator does not work well with quantitative variables), and Treatment each with KM estimators with respect to dtime, rtime, and drecurtime to grasp the survival time within each categories of the variables. 3.3.1 size vs. Survival Times size vs. dtime KM_None_Death &lt;- survfit(Surv(dtime, death) ~ size, data = rotterdam) plot(KM_None_Death, conf.type = &quot;plain&quot;, col = c(&quot;black&quot;,&quot;red&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;), xlab=&quot;Days&quot;, ylab=&quot;Survival&quot;) legend(6000, 1, legend=c(&quot;&lt;=20&quot;, &quot;20-50&quot;, &quot;&gt;50&quot;), col=c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), lty=1, cex=0.8, title=&quot;Tumor Size&quot;, text.font=6) size vs. rtime KM_None_Recur &lt;- survfit(Surv(rtime, recur) ~ size, data = rotterdam) plot(KM_None_Recur, conf.type = &quot;plain&quot;, col = c(&quot;black&quot;,&quot;red&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;), xlab=&quot;Days&quot;, ylab=&quot;Survival&quot;) legend(6000, 1, legend=c(&quot;&lt;=20&quot;, &quot;20-50&quot;, &quot;&gt;50&quot;), col=c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), lty=1, cex=0.8, title=&quot;Tumor Size&quot;, text.font=6) In general, patients with smaller tumor at diagnosis enjoys longer survival for both death and recurrence.

Based on the difference of treatment, we could see that chemotherapy has a better effect than hormontherapy with respect to death time and a smaller yet still better effect regarding the recurrence time. Treatment vs. drecurtime KM_Treatment_drecur &lt;- survfit(Surv(drecurtime, death) ~ Treatment, data = rotterdam_recur) plot(KM_Treatment_drecur, conf.int = FALSE, col = c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;), xlab=&quot;Days&quot;, ylab=&quot;Survival&quot;) legend(3700, 1, legend=c(&quot;Both&quot;, &quot;Chemo&quot;,&quot;Hormon&quot;, &quot;NaN/Other Treatment&quot;), col=c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;), lty=1, cex=0.8, title=&quot;Treatment Group&quot;, text.font=6) However, sadly enough, from the above plot we could see that no matter what treatment a patient use, it does not make a difference for the death survival time after cancer cells have recurred. This matches our conclusion from the visualization in Chapter 2. 3.4 Parametric Models Another point that we are going to explore is if we would be able to fit our data to a parametric model. This matters since if we could fit any parametric model, then we should have a model good enough to generate predictions of breast cancer patients' survival and would have nice and interpretable coefficients to work with. To do so, we will begin by checking if any of Exponential, Weibull, or Log-normal distribution would be adequate parametric assumption to cast on our data. We will verify the adequacy by checking the Cox-Snell residual plot. We will be fitting models using variables: Treatment, size, nodes, age(We have shown in Chapter 2 that age is a confounder for categories in Treatment). 3.4.1 User-defined Cox-Snell function # The Cox-Snell function takes as inputs # 1. A vector of Cox-Snell residuals created by the user based on the model being evaluated, # 2. A status vector # 3.
