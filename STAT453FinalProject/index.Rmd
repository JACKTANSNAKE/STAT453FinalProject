# Motivation

According to World Health Organization$*$, Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. And amongst all cancer types, breast cancer(along with lung cancer) has the top cases of death: 2.09 million cases in 2018. According to the CDC$*$, Breast cancer is also the second most common cancer among women in the United States, comprising 22.9% of invasive cancers in women and 16% of all female cancers. However, because of the cancer's characteristics, breast cancer patients have relatively high 5-year survival rate of 85% compared to other more lethal cancers according to research conducted in the UK$*$. We think it is worthwhile to look at the relationship between survival/recurrence time and some diagnostic criterion. We are also going to explore the effect of different treatments on survival/recurrence.

## Some Background Information

For doctors to be able to assess the severity and different types of breast cancer, researchers have come up with a diagnosing system called the TNM$*$ system that is widely used in the diagnostics of breast cancer:

**Tumor(T)**: How large is the primary tumor in the breast? 

**Node (N)**: Has the tumor spread to the lymph nodes? If so, where, what size, and how many?

**Metastasis (M)**: Has the cancer spread to other parts of the body?

Generally, the results from the above three features are combined to form a diagnosis of a total of 5 stages of breast cancer: stage 0 (zero), which is non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and stages I through IV (1 through 4), which are used for invasive breast cancer.

We will be using data related to this system, especially Tumor and Node(since metastasis is often not recorded in datasets), to conduct our exploration.
