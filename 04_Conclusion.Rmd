# Conclusion

From our research, we have seen and proven that though treatment(in our dataset) might appear to have different effect on patients, by including confounder and other factors, we do not have enough evidence that the difference is solid. For the TNM diagnostics of breast cancer, though we do not have data about metastasis, we still had significant result for the relationship between tumor size and number of lymph nodes tested positive. We have also seen that the most formidable aspect of breast cancer(or maybe all cancer) is the recurrence, as in our research there's not much time left if a patients tumor have recurred. But generally, breast cancer has a relative long survival and patients diagnosed with breast cancer should not be pessimistic but rather face reality and seek proper treatment. In this way, one might achieve as long survival as possible.

Of course, there are many limitations within our research and much more that we could explore in the realm of breast cancer. We will list a few for future study below. 

## Limitation

- As we have mentioned in Motivation, the TNM system for diagnosis of breast cancer relies on three important indicators, **Tumor**, **Node**, **Metastasis**. Now in our research, the dataset already contains information about tumor size and number of lymph nodes tested positive, but it does not contain any information about metastasis. However, as we have mentioned in Chapter 2, these information would not exist until a patient has developed a stage IV breast cancer. We don't know exactly if these patients were left out for a reason, but we still think that a more generalized subject pool would make the result of the research more convincing and more generalized. For future studies, we think that not only stage IV breast cancer patients but also stage I patients should all be recorded as part of the dataset.

- In Chapter 2, we compared the effect and the condition for choosing between chemotherapy and hormontherapy. We have had good results discerning the patients taking different therapy by age, as younger patients tend to take chemotherapy more and older patients tend to take hormontherapy more. And we have also seen that most patients with no lymph nodes tested positive choose neither of chemotherapy and hormontherapy. There might be other therapies that better suit mild condition patients. Additionally, nowadays, there are way more categories of therapies for breast cancer and many of them may have better effect on patients and less discerning characteristics like age with chemotherapy and hormontherapy. In future studies, these missing treatment shall be recorded, as it is critical to studying if the new methods are more effective and lasting treatment for breast cancer patients.

- In Chapter 3, we found out that in parametric models for recurrence vs. predictors, the coefficient for age is positive, which suggests that the older one patient is, the less likely he/she have recurred cancer. This counter-intuitive fact was explained by introducing the concept of competing risks. However, in the data that we obtained, there is no record of each patients' cause of death, and thus we could not conduct further analysis on what would be possible competing event that makes this relationship exist. In future study, if possible, researcher should try to record for patients with exact time of death their cause of death. In this manner, we might be able to study the causes of death for patients with breast cancer but did not die from the cancer itself.
